		<p>Hi there, i am Remi. I am an avid web application developer. I wrote <a target='_blank' href='http://github.com/rosengate/exedra'>exedra</a>, <u>a nestful route oriented PHP Framework</u>. This application was also built on exedra. I like to write things, in logical manner, and programming do suits me.</p>
		<p>Music is my other interest too! Check the link right there. I play guitar and keyboard. Had a lot of fun playing with friends, but well, now everyone get busy with marriage, it's ok I understand though.</p>
		<p>I am not a good UI designer, this site was built with bootstrap, a css framework. Well, it's a default bootstrap prototyping structure provided by <a target='_blank' href='http://www.pingendo.com/'>this cool desktop app</a> though. ;D. I like to design web interface and such, but i like a backend design more! Application structure, Design Pattern, Server, performance, optimization things and all that mental torture heck of things! But tell you what, this ui design looks clean right! ;)</p>
